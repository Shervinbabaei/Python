# Mini Project: Basic User Information System
# This project will ask the user for various pieces of information, perform some calculations and type conversions, 
# and display the results in a formatted way.

# Goal:
# Gather user input for name, age, GPA, and student status.
# Perform type conversions and calculations (e.g., next birthday, grade point change).
# Display everything in a formatted output.

# gathering user info
print("\n--- User Information ---")

name = input("What is your name?: ")

age = input("What is your age?: ")
gpa = float(input("What is your gpa?: "))
is_student = input("Are you a student? Yes or No:  ").lower() == 'yes'

# GPA calculation
next_age = int(age) + 1

print(f"Name: {name} {last_name}")
print(f"Current Age: {age}")
print(f"Current Gpa: {gpa}")
print(f"Student Status: {is_student}")
print(f"Next Year, you'll be: {next_age} years old!")
